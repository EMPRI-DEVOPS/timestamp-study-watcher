# Timestamp Study Watcher

This watcher accompanies [our study](https://empri-devops.de/timestamp-precision-study/) on user demand for timestamp precision on GitHub.
It checks on a daily basis if GitHub's site structure changed in a way that the locations of timestamps are no longer the same.
If that is the case, we are alerted and can make sure that these changes are taken into account when we evaluate the study.

For more information see also the study WebExtension at [EMPRI-DEVOPS/empri-browser-extension](https://github.com/EMPRI-DEVOPS/empri-browser-extension).
